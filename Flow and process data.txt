First, you need to add the http package to your project. 
You can do this by adding the following line to your pubspec.yaml file:

dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.4
  
  Then, you can use the http package to call an API.
  
  In the given code, the MyWidget widget calls the fetchData function in its initState method and stores the result in the data variable. If data is null, the widget shows a CircularProgressIndicator. Otherwise, it displays the data as text.

Depending on your specific API endpoint and data format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
